Comprehensive Example
=====================

This is a comprehensive example script written using the pyATS AEtest template.
Tihs example should be automatically copied into your pyATS instance as part
of the installation process.

The goal of this example is to demonstrate the following basics:

    - how AEtest works: features & flow
    - writing a straighforward, basic testscript:
        - script components and structure
        - various script features
    - script inheritance & variance
    - driving testscript with data/parameters
    - passing arguments from jobfile/commandline into the testscript.
    - importing local libraries & etc.

and is written to be self-explanatory. It is intended to act as a semi-guide,
walking users through important features and explaining them using live
examples, supplementing the full user guide at:
    http://wwwin-pyats.cisco.com/documentation/html/

This example is executable both under standalone execution, and through easypy.
You can modify parts of this code to see how it changes execution behaviors.

NOTE:
    Certain parts of this comprehensive example script does not follow the
    template to-the-tee, opting for a more fluid, linear-flow instead of
    full-scale abstraction. This is intentional.

This testscript is written using the AEtest template @ $VIRTUAL_ENV/templates/.
