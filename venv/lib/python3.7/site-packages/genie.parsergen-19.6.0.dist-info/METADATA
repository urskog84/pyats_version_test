Genie ParserGen Component
=========================

Genie Parsergen package provides a one-step parsing mechanism that is
capable of parsing dynamic tabular and non-tabular device outputs in a
noticeably less lines of code compared to the standard parsing mechanisms.

pyATS is an end-to-end testing ecosystem, specializing in data-driven and
reusable testing, and engineered to be suitable for Agile, rapid development
iterations. Extensible by design, pyATS enables developers start with small,
simple and linear test cases, and scale towards large, complex and asynchronous
test suites.

Genie was initially developed internally in Cisco, and is now available to the
general public starting early 2018 through `Cisco DevNet`_. Visit the Genie
