Genie Predcore Component
========================

Genie Predcore offers a collection of predicate and pre-requisite base classes
that provide a foundation for convenient, powerful and complex condition-driven
testing.

pyATS is an end-to-end testing ecosystem, specializing in data-driven and
reusable testing, and engineered to be suitable for Agile, rapid development
iterations. Extensible by design, pyATS enables developers start with small,
simple and linear test cases, and scale towards large, complex and asynchronous
test suites.

Genie was initially developed internally in Cisco, and is now available to the
general public starting early 2018 through `Cisco DevNet`_. Visit the Genie
