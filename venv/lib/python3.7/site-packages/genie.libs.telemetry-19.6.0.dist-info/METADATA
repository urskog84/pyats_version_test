Genie Telemetry libs Component
==============================

Genie Telemetry is a testbed Health Status Monitoring Tool. It is a package
within pyATS.

pyATS is an end-to-end testing ecosystem, specializing in data-driven and
reusable testing, and engineered to be suitable for Agile, rapid development
iterations. Extensible by design, pyATS enables developers start with small,
simple and linear test cases, and scale towards large, complex and asynchronous
test suites.

Genie was initially developed internally in Cisco, and is now available to the
general public starting early 2018 through `Cisco DevNet`_. Visit the Genie
